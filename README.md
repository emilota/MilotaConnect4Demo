* Built and run on Android.  Must be run in landscape mode.  Game play works [touch turns into mouse clicks].  However there's a bug from Title screen and Quit button.  It goes to Thanks for Playing screen but then returns to Title screen for some reason.  Need to investigate.

# Improvements that can be done
* Support touch 
* More optimized AI [currently brute force and not smart.  Would like to see places that you can go and determine to block you if that could get you a win]
* Use Checker class for grid entry pieces [rather than managing that seperately]
* Use Checker class for player select [rather than managing that seperately]
* Localization
* Sound
* More dynamic camera
* Better art
* Score keeping
* iOS/Android builds
* Steam builds
* AI vs AI?
* Better AI/Ability to change AI play modes on the fly
* Player vs Player via split screen
* Player vs Player via network
* Multiple player support
* Real time play as fast as possible game mode?
* Fullscreen/windows toggle
* Need to test for various screen resolutions/aspect ratios
* Prettier menus/buttons
